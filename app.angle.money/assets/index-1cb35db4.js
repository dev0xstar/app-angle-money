You receive stUSD or stEUR when depositing assets (USDA, USDC, EURC…) into the Angle savings product. stUSD and stEUR’s value continuously increases over time by accruing yield. Thus, 1 stUSD is worth more than $1 today, and 1 stEUR is worth more than 1€. stUSD and stEUR are ERC20 tokens available on multiple networks — you can freely swap them for any other token, anytime, anywhere."},{question:"Where does the yield come from?",answer:"stUSD and stEUR holders start earn a passive & native yield within seconds of acquiring stUSD or stEUR (whether by directly swapping assets or depositing stablecoins into the Angle savings product). Yield stems from returns generated by assets backing USDA and EURA (such as real-world assets and DeFi yield-bearing assets) as well as interest paid by USDA and EURA borrowers."},{question:"When will I start earning?",answer:"You will start earning yield immediately after acquiring stUSD or stEUR. Yield is distributed with every block (≈ 12 sec. on Ethereum). You’ll keep earning as long as you hold your stUSD or stEUR tokens. You can swap your stUSD or stEUR — whose value increases over time — at any time, but you will stop earning yield once you do."},{question:"What are the risks?",answer:e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:["As with any DeFi product, zero risk doesn't exist.
